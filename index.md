### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

	Lab 8 was a favorite because I had a really good group. When I try to remember one of the groups I worked together best with it would be my Lab 8 group as I had a group of 3 with Aidan and Nick and we worked together flawlessly. We completed parts 1 and 2 within the time of the class and I felt I learned a lot about teamwork doing the lab with them.

* Lab 2

	Lab 2 was a favorite because although I do have a background in programming before this class, I had no idea how terminal commands worked. This lab was the foundation for me to learn how terminal commands work. This was very important to me because every lab after this one needed many terminal commands which I kept referencing back to this lab for assistance, now I learned all my terminal commands.

* Lab 7

	Lab 7 was a favorite because it's the first lab where we can use our knowledge we have gained so far, especially functions in this case, to make a game. I have a background in game development so being able to do something I love, making a game (blackjack), was really refreshing from the last labs. I felt it really helped me learn the intricacies of using functions to make a game.
